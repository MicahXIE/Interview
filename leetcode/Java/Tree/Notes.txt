Binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

 Binary search tree (BST), also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the node's left subtree and less than those in its right subtree.

前序遍历(Pre-Order Traversal) : 指先访问根，然后访问子树的遍历方式
中序遍历(In-Order Traversal) : 指先访问左（右）子树，然后访问根，最后访问右（左）子树的遍历方式
后序遍历(Post-Order Traversal) : 指先访问子树，然后访问根的遍历方式
