Binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

 Binary search tree (BST), also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the node's left subtree and less than those in its right subtree.
