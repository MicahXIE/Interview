- LeetCode 141. Linked List Cycle ï¼ˆEasy) fast-slow pointer

  Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

  To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.
